## SSL at 18F

18F is an all-SSL shop: all of our [websites](https://18f.gsa.gov/) and [APIs](https://github.com/18F/api-standards#always-use-https) enforce encryption. We do this no matter how static or dynamic the content, and no matter how sensitive the information may appear to be.

This repository contains our:

* **operational practices** ,e.g. key generation, cert rotation
* **technical standards**, e.g. SSL/nginx/CDN configuration
* **external collaboration** on broadening SSL deployment and quality

_Technical Note_: "SSL" is used here as a synonym for [**TLS**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) and [**HTTPS**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure).
