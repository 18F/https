# HTTP Strict Transport Security: tells browsers to require https:// without first checking
# the http:// version for a redirect. Warning: it is difficult to change your mind.
# 
#    max-age: length of requirement in seconds (31536000 = 1 year)
#    includeSubdomains: force SSL for *ALL* subdomains (remove if this is not what you want)
#    preload: indicates you want browsers to ship with HSTS preloaded for your domain.
# 
#    Submit your domain for preloading in browsers at: https://hstspreload.appspot.com
